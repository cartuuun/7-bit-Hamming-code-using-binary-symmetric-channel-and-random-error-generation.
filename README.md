# 7-bit-Hamming-code-using-binary-symmetric-channel-and-random-error-generation.
7-bit Hamming code with random error generation – Input: Digital data stream Procedure: Consider a digital data stream of 16 or more bits. Tokenise it into 4-bit datawords, using even parity compute the codeword at the sender end. Now, use random error generation to generate a random error in the codeword and send that to the receiver end. At the receiver end, check if there has been an error and correct the error. – Output: Digital data stream that was fed to the system, codeword formed for each dataword at the sender site, codeword received at the receiver after random error generation, whether error is detected or not, if there is one error return its location and correct it to extract correct dataword.
